NOTES
	: luaobjc is derived from the LuaObjCBridge written by Tom McClean and distributed from
	: http://www.pixelballistics.com. He did the heavy lifting in writing the core code to call
	: objective-c methods from lua, but no longer has the time to maintain the bridge.  I don't have
	: the time to maintain it either :-), but I am using it and have been bugfixing, and if the code
	: is up on luaforge, maybe others will be able to help out.
	
	Done
		x removed LuaObjcBinding-Prefix.h, appears to do nothing
		x usable as a loadable module (objc.m)
		x implement objc.autoreleasepool() (most methods in Foundation can't be called without a pool)
		x quick hack to allow const strings as args, as in [NSString stringWithCString:cstr]
		x gc.lua example, showing unbounded memory usage... :-(
		x ab.lua example, showing loading of AddressBook framework

	Todo
		_ use full userdata instead of tables for id
		_ define metatables specific to NSArray/NSDictionary, NSNumber, NSString, etc.
		_ allow table arguments to objc method calls
		_ cache results from NSSelectorFromString() if benchmarks show it helps performance

	Data structure
		objc is the module table
			; objc = {
			;   class = lua_objc_lookup_class
			;   __lua_objc_ids = {
			;     <light userdara of value ptr> = <light userdata of id>
			;   }
		id (an obj-c object) is represented as a table:
			; id = {}
			; id->metatable = {
			;   __index = lua_objc_method_lookup
			;   __gc    = lua_objc_release
			;   __lua_objc_id = <light userdata of id>
			; }
			_ FIXME id uses {}, not userdata, so __gc is never called!
		string, number, and boolean all have the same metatable as an id, minus the __lua_objc_id
			: its presence is used as a flag, if there is a metatable for the value, its "pointer"
			: is looked up in objc.__lua_objc_ids, to find an id for this value
			_ FIXME this doesn't work,
				_ id is randomly lost
					: NSStrings that compare equal will have the same lua pointer
				_ no garbage collection on this table, it is a memory leak!
					: not sure how this could be fixed
			: Why is all this done, anyhow, why not attach appropriate metatables to userdata?
